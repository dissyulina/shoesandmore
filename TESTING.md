### **1. User Stories Testing**  
As a shopper I want to be able to:

1. Quickly identify what products/services the site sells.  
   Company logo is visible right at the top-center of the homepage. The company name is straightforward describing what products we sell. On top of that, the hero image is clearly picturing shoes as the main product. As users scrolls down the home page, they will find various navigation using large images of the products.

2. Quickly identify deals and special offers. 
   As users scrolls down the homepage, they will find the Final Sale section. When the 'Shop Now' button is clicked, they will be directed to the products page with all the sale items already filtered.

3. Search for a product.  
   Users can search for a product right away when they open the website. The search functionality is located at the top-left of screen on desktop, and on right side on mobile.

4. Identify a glimpse of most populars products.  
   Still on the homepage, users will also find 8 most popular (best-sellers) products on the website. They are displayed as a multi-items carousel, and users can navigate to the left and right by clicking the arrows.
