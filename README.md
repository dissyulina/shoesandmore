![The website's structure](readme-testing-files/readme/structure.png "The website's structure")   
There's a clear page access separation between unregistered users and registered user. While unregistered users can still purchase products and receive the confirmation via email, they are not able to:
- View their order history
- Give reviews (and edit or delete their reviews accordingly)  
- Make a favorite list of products.  

Those features mentioned are available for registered users.

<br/>  

### **4. Skeleton Plane**  
Wireframes were created using Figma to design the navigation and interface of the website. The wireframes were created only for desktop, which then will be transformed to high fidelity mock-ups in various device sizes (see Surface Plane).

### **5. Surface Plane**  
High fidelity mock-ups were created using Figma as well for a better and clearer visualization before coding, and also to check if the color scheme and images match and work great together. This has allowed the developer to concentrate solely on the development part (front end and back end), as the design has already made with such details. The high fidelity mock-ups were created in three different device sizes - desktop, tablet, and mobile.

#### **Color Scheme**  
The overall color-theme of the website was natural earthy colors, which have relaxing and comforting influences, and encourages feelings of warmth and calmness. Using [Coolors](https://coolors.co), I started with beige (#E8DCD5) and brown (#644536), and generated one more color that compliments them both - the result was a salmon color (#B2675E). I also found a hero image that fits the overal theme and colors accordingly.

#### **Typography**  
All of the fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).   
- Main font: Noto Sans   
   Noto Sans is a sans-serif font, used as the main font, for all paragraphs and buttons. Open Sans was chosen because it has a modern and clean style. 
- Secondary font: DM Serif Display    
   DM Serif Display is a serif font, used as the headers font on the Home page, in order to contrast them with serif font.
