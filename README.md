<br/>  

### **3. Structure Plane**  
The website was organized in a Hierarchical Tree Structure that ensures the user can navigate easily and intuitively. Below is the website workflow (was designed using [Creately](https://creately.com/)).  

![The website's structure](readme-testing-files/readme/structure.png "The website's structure")   
There's a clear page access separation between unregistered users and registered user. While unregistered users can still purchase products and receive the confirmation via email, they are not able to:
- View their order history
- Give reviews (and edit or delete their reviews accordingly)  
- Make a favorite list of products.  

Those features mentioned are available for registered users.

<br/>  

### **4. Skeleton Plane**  
Wireframes were created using Figma to design the navigation and interface of the website. The wireframes were created only for desktop, which then will be transformed to high fidelity mock-ups in various device sizes (see Surface Plane). 

- [Wireframe for Home page](readme-testing-files/readme/wireframes/wireframe-home.png)

- [Wireframe for Log In page](readme-testing-files/readme/wireframes/wireframe-login.png)  

<br/>  

### **5. Surface Plane**  
High fidelity mock-ups were created using Figma as well for a better and clearer visualization before coding, and also to check if the color scheme and images match and work great together. This has allowed the developer to concentrate solely on the development part (front end and back end), as the design has already made with such details. The high fidelity mock-ups were created in three different device sizes - desktop, tablet, and mobile.

- [High Fidelity Mock-up for Log In page](readme-testing-files/readme/high-fidelity-mockups/mockup-login.png)  

#### **Color Scheme**  
The overall color-theme of the website was natural earthy colors, which have relaxing and comforting influences, and encourages feelings of warmth and calmness. Using [Coolors](https://coolors.co), I started with beige (#E8DCD5) and brown (#644536), and generated one more color that compliments them both - the result was a salmon color (#B2675E). I also found a hero image that fits the overal theme and colors accordingly.   
![The color scheme](readme-testing-files/readme/color-scheme.png "The color scheme")  

#### **Typography**  
All of the fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com).   
- Main font: Noto Sans   
   Noto Sans is a sans-serif font, used as the main font, for all paragraphs and buttons. Open Sans was chosen because it has a modern and clean style. 
- Secondary font: DM Serif Display    
   DM Serif Display is a serif font, used as the headers font on the Home page, in order to contrast them with serif font.  


#### **Design Changes on The Final Product**  
While I relied heavily on these Wireframes in order to maintain the desired design, there are several differences between the Mockups and the final product:
- I changed the logo to a new one that's thicker and easier to spot, as the previous logo in the mockups was too thin and didn't look good on small devices.
- In the wireframes and mockups, there was a subscription to the newsletter box. I decided not to include this subscription to the newsletter functionality on the final product due to time constraint. 
- The color #B2675E was changed to a slightly dark color #A5554C, because it didn't have enough contrast when paired with white text.
- Minor things like buttons colors and image difference were purely design choices that was taken during with the website development. 


<br/>  

## **Database Design**    

Database schema was designed using [drawsql](https://drawsql.app/). The database was first managed using SQLite during the development process, then Postgres in production with Heroku.

   - The Category model and Subcategory model have no relationship. I decided not to define a relationship/ pairing between them to make it more flexible. Both are fully independent of each other.

   - Products field: the list of products.  
   - Because there would be a many to many relationship between favorites and products, i.e. one product can be listed in multiple (users) favorites , and one favorites can have multiple of products, I decided to define a through/ intermediary model between the two models ([source from django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ManyToManyField.through_fields)). The through model named  **FavoritesItem model**, which stores each product in one table with favorites as a foreign key.  

- **Topic model**
  - Stores the topics of contact form. 
  - Subject field: a one-word name for database purposes.
  - Text field: a longer name for display on the contact form.
  - I decided to make this into separate model instead of a choice field, because I wanted to define a separate naming fields for database and for display, and for future flexibility in adding/ editing/ removing a topic.  

- **ContactForm model**
  - Stores the contact form filled by the user.
  - Name field: the name of the user.

<br/>  

## **Features**  
### **A. General Design Features**  
- **Fully responsive** - Each page of the site is fully responsive on all device sizes (with minimum dimension 320px or an iPhone 4/5) and features intuitive navigational buttons.  

- **Navbar** (on all pages)   
   ![The Navbar on desktop](readme-testing-files/readme/navbar-desktop.png "The Navbar on desktop")   

   - The Navbar is responsive and turns to a hamburger menu on a smaller device. It is also sticky, thus it follows along when the user scrolls down, so the user can easily navigate the site without scrolling back to the top.
   - The logo is placed at the top center of the Navbar, creating a simmetry between left and right, and links back to Home page.
   - A search box is positioned on the left side of the Navbar, providing the ease of searching a keyword from the beginning. 
   - For unregistered users, the Sign In buttons are visible right away, conventionally placed at the top-right of the page. It's a dropdown link which will give options to Register or to Log In. After the user successfully logged in, the previously Sign In button turns to a My Account dropdown button, which provides the links to My Profile and to Log Out.
   - Favorites and Shopping Bag links are placed on the Navbar to give a quick access from any page the user is currently at.   
   - There are 6 nav-links to navigate between products categories and subcategories - All Products, Women, Men, Kids, Accessories, and Sale.
   - A sales banner about free delivery is placed right below the Navbar, and also displayed on all pages.  

- **Footer** (on all pages)  
   ![The Footer on desktop](readme-testing-files/readme/footer-desktop.png "The Footer on desktop") 
   The Footer uses the same color as the Navbar and provides all navigation links, the social media links of the store as well (that opens in a new tab), and the logo that leads back to the Home page.  

- **Toast message**   
Toast messages provide the user the necessary feedback of their activities whether it's successfully executed or not. The toast messages are color coded: red for error messages, blue for info/ alert messages, yellow for warning messages, and green for succcess messages. Users will get success toast the most, for example when users add a product to the shopping bag, they will get a success toast message with bag display. While when users for example add a product to their favorites list, they will get a success toast message without bag display. Below are the examples of success toast messages (without bag and with bag display).   
![Success toast message - without bag display](readme-testing-files/readme/toast-suceess-nobag.png "Success toast message - without bag display")
![Success toast message - with bag display](readme-testing-files/readme/toast-success.png "Success toast message - with bag display")   


### **B. Page Features**  
#### **1. Home Page**  
[See the image of the Homepage here](readme-testing-files/readme/home-page.png)   
- On the Home page, I used multiple images as a marketing strategy to attract users attention to browse more into the website, and hopefully to make a purchase.  
- The hero-image covers 100% of the viewport height and width, with an impactful heading in a jumbotron to give the user a great first impression. It introduces the new arrivals, which are products for spring, with a CTA button to directly browse the new arrivals.  
- The sneakers collection section provides direct navigation to the sneakers.  
- The shoes for the whole family section provides direct navigation to the main categories based on gender/ age: Women, Men, and Kids.  
- The best sellers section gives information to users which products have been purchased the most, which indicates the most popular products. The products are displayed in a multi-items carousel of 8 products.  
- The final sale section provides direct navigation to the sale products.   
- The bags and accesssories section provides direct navigation to the accessories products.  
- The articles and blogs section displays the latest 3 articles written by store admin or other superusers. Users can also navigate to the articles page and view all articles by clicking the See More Articles button.  

#### **2. Products Page**  
[See the image of Products page here](readme-testing-files/readme/products.png)   
- The Products page starts with a breadcrumb navigation that indicates the current pageâ€™s location within a navigational hierarchy. For example, if the user chose the Women Sneakers, then the breadcrumb will show: Home > Women > Sneakers.
- Below the breadcrumb there's a 'Final Sale' banner, as normally users are interested in checking out the sale items first. If users click the shop now button, it will filter the products to display only the sale items.  
- Side Navigation feature (only on desktop) helps users to quickly navigate through the categories and subcategories, and will filter the products to display only the categories and subcategories of choice. On smaller devices, users can click the hamburger icon to navigate.
- The result of products displayed can also be sorted by price, rating, and name.
- The products are displayed into 4 columns on large screen, 3 columns on medium screen, and 2 columns on small screen.  
- On the top right of each of the product's image, there's a heart icon that turns red when user hovers over it. By clicking this icon, a registered user can add the product to their favorites list. The heart icon will then turns red to indicate that the product has listed in user's favorites.
- A back to top button is in fixed positioned on the right side of the screen.  

#### **3. Individual Product Page**  
[See the image of Individual Product page here](readme-testing-files/readme/individual-product-page.png)  
- The Individual Product page starts with a breadcrumb navigation that indicates the current pageâ€™s location within a navigational hierarchy. 
- The page features the product's image, name, price, rating, category tag, and reviews on the bottom of the page. 
- On the top right of the product's image, there's a heart icon that turns red when user hovers over it. By clicking this icon, a registered user can add the product to their favorites list. The heart icon will then turns red to indicate that the product has listed in user's favorites.
- Users can add the product to their shopping bag by choosing the size, the quantity, and click Add to Bag button.  
- A registered user is able to edit or delete their own review. The buttons to edit and to delete show up below it.

[See the image of Favorites page here](readme-testing-files/readme/favorites-page.png)  
- The Favorites page features all products that the user has been saved as their favorites. The products are displayed in resemblance with products page, using the product's image, name, price, and rating. They are displayed into 4 columns on large screen, 3 columns on medium screen, and 2 columns on small screen. 
- The heart icon on the top right of product's image is replaced by a trash icon, which indicates its function to remove the product from favorites.
- Since favorites are a list of products that the user is interested in and willing to buy, below each product, there are an option to choose the size and an Add to Bag button. This allows users to add the product to their shopping bag directly and easily, without going to the individual product page.  

#### **5. Bag Page**  
[See the image of Bag page here](readme-testing-files/readme/bag-page.png)

- It displays the products information such as product's image, name, sku, price, size of choice, and the quantity of choice.
- A trash icon is placed on each product's row, which indicates that users can use this button to remove the specified product from their bag.
- The subtotal column informs users the product's price times the quantity. If the user changes the quantity, the subtotal changes accordingly.
- The total price, the delivery price, and the grand total are separated in a box, to gain user's attention on what the next action is. A CTA button to chekout, and a visual information of accepted method of payments are placed in the box as well.
- If the user decides to browse for more products, a Keep Shopping button is positioned below the grand total box as a secondary option.
